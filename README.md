# Overview

>   **CIRPG**: siː aɪ ɑː piː ʤiː | Noun  
>   Acronym: Code Institute Role Playing Game.  
>   A Full Stack Role-Playing Game, filled with loot fuelled endorphins, stunning hand drawn
>   graphics, and a Leaderboard to lose friends over.  
>   *“You should have seen the Mythic item I pulled on* **CIRPG** *last night!”*

**CIRPG** is browser-based Full Stack Role-Playing Game, which allows users to
create a character, embark on an endless adventure, and aim for a place on the
Leaderboard. As users progress through the game, they earn experience, level up,
and find new weapons to equip. Whilst the mechanics behind the gameplay are
complex, the gameplay itself is simple, fun, and intuitive.

The project was developed using **Python** (Django), **HTML**, **CSS**,
**JavaScript**, and utilises an SQL database via **PostreSQL**.

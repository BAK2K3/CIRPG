                                <h5>Overview</h5>
                                <p>Make an account, create a character, and battle your way through an endless set of encounters with the hopes of finding the most powerful loot, and making your way to the top of the leaderboard.</p>
                                <h5>Create a Character</h5>
                                <p>From the Create screen, choose any of the available characters and confirm your selection. You will be allocated a random weapon.</p>
                                <h5>Profile</h5>
                                <p>Your profile displays your account's statistics, including Total Runs, Longest Run, Current Streak, and account type. If you have an active character, your character's stats will be displayed here, along with your 
                                    XP progress to your character's next level, and the weapon your character currently yields.</p> 
                                <h5>Battle</h5>
                                <p>When you enter a battle, your enemy and their weapon are generated at random, based on your current level. Once you commence the battle, you will be prompted when it is your turn, whereby you can attempt to attack your enemy.
                                    Enemies will automatically attempt to attack you when it is their turn. The red bar represents Hit Points, and the green bar represents the Turn Meter. 
                                    The first character to reduce their opponent's hit points to 0 wins.</p>
                                <h5>Lose</h5>
                                <p>If you lose, your character is wiped and you start from the beginning. You will be directed to a post-battle screen which displays your score. 
                                    If you are a premium user, and you are within the top 10 scorers, you will earn a place on the leaderboard.</p>
                                <h5>Win</h5>
                                <p>If you win, a new weapon is generated at random based on your current level, and you can choose to keep your old weapon, or take the new one.</p>
                                <h5>Level Up</h5>
                                <p>For each win, you gain XP (Experience Points) relative to the level of the enemy you have beaten. If you level up following a successful battle, you are presented with your previous stats, 
                                    and your new modified stats, in the loot screen.</p>

                                    But what do the Tiers mean? As an Enemy's or Item's Tier increases, their <em>Base Stats</em> increase. I hear you...<em>"Surely a measly extra 2 attack damage isn't going to do much!"</em>  
                                    And you might be right, if that Tier 5 <strong>Cthulu Enchanter</strong> was only level one. But At level 5, the effect the accumulative levelling has on these measly extra stats is exponential. Just you wait.

                                    During a battle, you can see the Tier of an Item or an Enemy by the amount of stars <span class="fa fa-star"></span> on their avatar.

                                <p class="mb-0">When items are generated, they always have a rarity tied to them. These rarities are as follows, and are depicted by the following stars within a Battle:</p>
                                <br>
                                <p class="mb-0"><span class="far fa-star"></span> Common</p>
                                <p class="mb-0"><span class="fa fa-star"></span> Uncommon</p>
                                <p class="mb-0"><span class="fa fa-star rarity-3"></span>  Rare</p>
                                <p class="mb-0"><span class="fa fa-star rarity-4"></span>  Epic</p>
                                <p class="mb-0"><span class="fa fa-star rarity-5"></span>  Mythical</p>
                                <br>
                                <p class="mb-0">You unlock each rarity sequentially as you level up, so at Level 1 you will only pull Uncommon items. At Level 3 you can pull Common, Uncommon, and Rare items.
                                As you level up, the probability of you pulling a Rarity below your level increases.</p> 
                                <br>
                                <p class="mb-0">
                                For example, at Level 2 there is a 20% chance of pulling an Uncommon item.
                                At level 3, you have a 40% chance of pulling an Uncommon item, and a 20% chance of pulling a Rare Item. However, in order for the item to be Rare, it must first have successively "rolled" as Uncommon. 
                                    Which equates to about an 8% chance of you pulling an Rare item at Level 3.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p class="mb-0">The effect Rarity has on weapons is the same effect levelling up has on Characters and Enemies. A Rare item will have had all its stats multiplied 3 times. Mythical items will have had their stats multiplied 5 times.
                                    The level of a weapon effects the possible range of multiplier generated per Tier of multiplication.
